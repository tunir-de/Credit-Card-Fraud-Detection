# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project implements a machine learning–based credit card fraud detection system using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on historical transaction data to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, handling class imbalance, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC.

The goal of this project is to build an efficient and interpretable fraud detection model that helps reduce financial losses and enhance transaction security.
